# Project X
WIP - Not ready for primetime or contributions

The purpose of Project X is to add some missing features to Github's project boards. Initially, this will be:
* Time estimates added to Issues
* Time spent on tracked in PRs
* Time remaining/over tracked in PRs
* Visual display of these items in the project board cards and side panels in the the Issues and Pull Requests tabs with the help of browser plugins for Chrome and Firefox

More features will be added over time, and some will be removed as Github makes ProjectX features redundant with native support.

### Topology
A Rails API server, postgresql database, and Javascript browser extensions.
